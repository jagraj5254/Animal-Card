						Scary fact: A rabbit’s teeth never stop growing. Fortunately, they’re naturally kept short by the normal wear and tear of chewing. Lots and lots of chewing, that is — about 120 times a minute.

						Rabbits are small mammals with fluffy, short tails, whiskers and distinctive long ears. There are more than 30 species around the world, and while they live in many different environments, they have many things in common. Some rabbits are about the size of a cat, and some can grow to be as big as a small child. Rabbits are herbivores. This means that they have a plant-based diet and do not eat meat.
